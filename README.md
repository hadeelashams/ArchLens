# ArchLens

ARCH LENS proposes a centralized digital platform that replaces manual measurements with 
Computer Vision automation. Unlike traditional calculators, this system adopts a Budget-First 
approach, where the user’s financial target and quality preference (Economy, Standard, Luxury) 
guide the entire estimation process. The system accepts standard JPG/PNG floor plan images. 
Using OpenCV-based image processing, it automatically detects walls, room boundaries, and 
openings to extract base 2D measurements. However, a 2D plan is insufficient for a full BOQ. To 
address this, the system features a Stage-wise Interactive Wizard. After the initial scan, users are 
guided through specific construction phases—Substructure, Superstructure, and Finishes. The 
system automatically maps these phases to an internal real-time Material Rate Database, 
eliminating the need for users to research market prices. This hybrid approach combines AI 
precision (for measuring areas) with System-driven pricing logic, resulting in a highly accurate, 
customized, and budget-aware Bill of Quantities.
