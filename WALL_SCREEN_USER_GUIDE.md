# Wall Screen - Economy Tier Optimization Guide

## What Changed?

The Wall Screen has been optimized to provide professional-grade material estimates with special focus on **Economy budget projects**.

---

## 🎯 Key Features for Economy Tier

### 1. **Accurate Perimeter-Based Calculations**
- Instead of guessing, the system now calculates **actual wall perimeters** from your floor plan
- Eliminates underestimation in smaller homes
- More accurate material quantities

### 2. **15% Mortar Wastage Factor**
- Accounts for real-world construction losses:
  - Brick indentations (frogs) that hold mortar
  - Onsite spillage during laying
  - Joining imperfections
- **Result**: Prevents running out of mortar mid-construction

### 3. **Smart 3-inch AAC Block Selection** (Economy Only)
- **Automatically recommends 3-inch AAC blocks** for partition walls in Economy tier
- Why? **80% less mortar required** = massive savings
- Example savings:
  - 24"×3" AAC block covers 2.7x more area than 9"×3" clay brick
  - Even though AAC costs more per unit, total project cost is cheaper
  - Less cement/sand = faster construction = lower labor costs

### 4. **Fly Ash Brick Prioritization** (Load-Bearing)
- AI recommends **Fly Ash bricks** instead of Red Clay for load-bearing walls
- **15-20% cost savings** with same strength
- More environmentally sustainable

### 5. **AI Engineering Insight Badge**
- Appears below the total cost in Economy tier
- Shows: **"Saves ~X% on total masonry cost"**
- Explains exactly why materials were chosen
- Example:
  ```
  📊 AI Engineering Insight
  💰 Saves ~20% on total masonry cost
  Fly Ash bricks save 20% vs clay bricks
  AAC blocks use 80% less mortar
  ```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Enter Room Dimensions
- Floor plan analysis automatically detects walls
- System calculates actual perimeter (NOT guesses)

### Step 2: Select Budget Tier
- Choose **Economy** for maximum cost optimization
- AI automatically selects materials optimized for savings

### Step 3: Click "AI Select" (Optional)
- Recommended materials appear with cost savings breakdown
- You can still manually modify selections
- Badge shows why each material was chosen

### Step 4: Review Estimates
- **Loading Length**: Calculated from rooms (no more 0.55 multiplier!)
- **Mortar Qty**: Includes 15% wastage for real-world conditions
- **Partition Thickness**: Dynamic (3" for AAC, 4.5" for standard)
- **Cost Breakdown**: Clear line items with material choices

## Cost Savings Examples

### Small Home (1000 sqft) - Economy Tier
| Factor | Savings |
|--------|---------|
| Fly Ash instead of Clay | -12% |
| 3-inch AAC instead of 4.5" brick | -18% |
| Leaner mortar (1:6 vs 1:4) | -8% |
| **Total Potential Savings** | **~25-30%** |

### Medium Home (2500 sqft) - Economy Tier
| Factor | Savings |
|--------|---------|
| Fly Ash instead of Clay | -12% |
| 3-inch AAC instead of 4.5" brick | -20% |
| Leaner mortar (1:6 vs 1:4) | -10% |
| **Total Potential Savings** | **~32-40%** |

## Material Recommendations

### For Load-Bearing Walls
**Economy**: Fly Ash Bricks (₹6-6.50/unit)
- Cost-effective
- Durable and strong
- 15-20% cheaper than clay

**Standard/Luxury**: Clay Bricks or Concrete Blocks
- Premium quality
- Higher aesthetic value
- Better long-term performance

### For Partition Walls
**Economy**: 3-inch AAC Blocks (₹29-32/unit)
- 80% less mortar needed
- Larger block size = fewer pieces needed
- Total cost lower despite higher per-unit price

**Standard**: 4-inch AAC Blocks (₹42-45/unit)
- Balanced cost and performance
- Good sound insulation

**Luxury**: 4-inch AAC or Dry Wall
- Better insulation
- Premium finish options

### For Mortar
**Economy**: 1:6 cement-to-sand ratio for partitions
- Lower cement consumption
- Sufficient for internal walls
- 1:4 for load-bearing walls

**Standard/Luxury**: 1:4 cement-to-sand ratio
- Traditional strength
- Better durability

## FAQs

**Q: Why does the 3-inch AAC block cost more per unit but save overall?**
A: Because a 24"×3" AAC block covers 2.7x more area than a 9"×3" clay brick. You need far fewer blocks AND 80% less mortar. The total project cost is lower.

**Q: Will I run out of mortar with the 15% wastage factor?**
A: No! The 15% wastage factor ensures you have enough mortar for real-world conditions (brick indentations, spillage, joining imperfections).

**Q: Can I override the AI recommendations?**
A: Yes! AI recommendations are suggestions. You can manually select any available material.

**Q: How is the wall running length calculated?**
A: The system now calculates actual perimeters from room dimensions: 2 × (length + width) for each room. No more guessing!

**Q: What if I don't have room dimensions?**
A: The system falls back to area-based estimation (4 × √area) if room data is unavailable.

**Q: Is the 3-inch AAC option available only for Economy?**
A: You can select 3-inch AAC for any tier, but Economy tier auto-selects it for cost optimization.
